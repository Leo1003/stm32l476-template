# `STM32-L476-quickstart`

> A template for building applications for STM32 L476 series MPU

This project is developed and maintained by the [Cortex-M team][team].
And modified by Leo Chen.

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- Rust 1.31, 1.30-beta, nightly-2018-09-13 or a newer toolchain. e.g. `rustup
  default beta`

- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate#installation).

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:

``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

**NOTE**: This is the very short version that only covers building programs. For
the long version, which additionally covers flashing, running and debugging
programs, check [the embedded Rust book][book].

0. Before we begin you need to identify some characteristics of the target
  device as these will be used to configure the project:

- The STM32 L476 MPU. e.g. STM32 L476RG.

- How much Flash memory and RAM does the target device has? e.g. 1024 KiB of
  Flash and 96 KiB of RAM.

You can find this information in the data sheet or the reference manual of your
device.

1. Instantiate the template.

``` console
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/Leo1003/stm32l476-template
 Project Name: app
 Creating project called `app`...
 Done! New project created /tmp/app

$ cd app
```

2. Enter the memory region information into the `memory.x` file.

``` console
$ cat memory.x
/* Linker script for the STM32F303VCT6 */
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE 1 K = 1 KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  FLASH : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 1M
  RAM : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 96K
}
```

3. Build the template application or one of the examples.

``` console
$ cargo build
```

## VS Code

This template includes launch configurations for debugging CortexM programs with Visual Studio Code located in the `.vscode/` directory.  
See [.vscode/README.md](./.vscode/README.md) for more information.  
If you're not using VS Code, you can safely delete the directory from the generated project.
